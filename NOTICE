NOTICE - Model License Information

This project uses derivative models based on Meta's DINOv3,
a self-supervised Vision Transformer model.

==========================================================================

1. Base Model
   - Model: facebook/dinov3-vitl16-pretrain-lvd1689m (DINOv3 ViT-Large)
   - Provider: Meta AI
   - License: DINOv3 License (https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/dinov3-license/)
   - Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10104
   - Repository: https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov3

2. Modifications
   This project includes the following modifications to the original model:
   - LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation, r=64, alpha=256) fine-tuning on a custom
     eggplant disease recognition dataset
     (Kaggle: sujaykapadnis/eggplant-disease-recognition-dataset)
   - Classification head (LayerNorm + Dropout + Linear) added on top of
     the vision encoder for 7-class disease classification
   - Training with data augmentation (RandomHorizontalFlip, ColorJitter),
     Label Smoothing (0.1), and Cosine Annealing LR Scheduler

3. Permitted Uses
   - Research and academic use is permitted
   - Please refer to the DINOv3 License for full terms regarding
     commercial use, redistribution, and other usage conditions

4. Redistribution Requirements
   If you redistribute this derivative model, you must:
   - Include a copy of or reference to the DINOv3 License
   - Clearly state that the model has been modified from the original
