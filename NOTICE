NOTICE - Model License Information

This project uses pre-trained models from torchvision (PyTorch).
All models are fine-tuned on a custom eggplant disease recognition dataset.

==========================================================================

1. Pre-trained Models Used
   - ResNet-50 (Microsoft Research, "Deep Residual Learning")
   - DenseNet-201 (Facebook AI Research, "Densely Connected Convolutional Networks")
   - ConvNeXt-Base (Facebook AI Research, "A ConvNet for the 2020s")
   - All weights sourced from torchvision (BSD 3-Clause License)

2. Dataset
   - Kaggle: sujaykapadnis/eggplant-disease-recognition-dataset
   - 1,400 images, 7 classes of eggplant leaf diseases

3. Modifications
   This project includes the following modifications to the original models:
   - Classification head replaced with Dropout (0.4) + Linear layer
     for 7-class disease classification
   - Full fine-tuning with data augmentation (RandomHorizontalFlip,
     RandomVerticalFlip, RandomRotation, ColorJitter, RandomErasing),
     Label Smoothing (0.1), and Cosine Annealing LR Scheduler
   - Ensemble inference using Hard Voting across 3 models
